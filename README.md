# Helsinki-Libraries-D3-data-viz
This is a stacked bar chart visualization of three Helsinki libraries made using the D3 JavaScript library

There are 2 index js files, one called harcode_index.js, and one called index.js. hardcode_index.js contains all of the data hardcoded. 
This is so that the visualization can be tested out by running the index.html file locally in your browser with index_hardcode.js as the src. 
Therefore if you would like to use a csv or json you will need to go into the index.html file and change the src from index_hardcode.js to index.js.
You will also need to chose the corrosponding import line in the index.js file for either csv or json depending on what format you are using.
